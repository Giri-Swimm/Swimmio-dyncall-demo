title: Location and Store Data Initialization
---
This document describes how location and store data records are prepared and normalized before further business processing. The flow validates incoming data, applies business rules to handle missing or invalid fields, and ensures the record is ready for downstream operations.

# Spec

## Detailed View of the Program's Functionality

# Swimmio-dyncall-demo: Detailed Flow Explanation

---

## a. Startup and Preprocessing

When the program starts, it performs a series of initialization steps to prepare the environment for further processing:

- It resets or initializes several working areas and status flags to ensure a clean state.
- It copies an index handle from a parameter area to a working area, and resets checkpoint and SQL-related flags.
- Unless the operation is specifically a cursor close, it proceeds to copy and normalize location data from the input structure to the internal working structure, preparing it for further processing.
- If the operation involves Oracle (or certain types of row modifications), it establishes a connection to the Oracle database, handling any connection errors by capturing the error code and building an error message.

---

## b. Location Data Preparation and Validation

This is a critical section where the program ensures that all location and store-related fields are properly validated and normalized before any database operations:

- **Field Copying and Defaulting:**\
  Each field from the input structure is examined. If a field is missing, blank, or contains an invalid value (such as a blank or zero date, or a non-numeric value where a number is expected), the program assigns a business-defined default value (e.g., a default date, zero, or a placeholder string).
- **Indicator Handling:**\
  For fields that are missing or invalid, corresponding indicator variables are set to signal this status. These indicators are used later for database operations that support nulls or require special handling.
- **Business Rule Application:**\
  Certain flags and switches are set or defaulted according to business rules. For example, if a store type code is blank, it is defaulted to a specific value. Numeric fields are validated and defaulted to zero if not numeric.
- **Special Handling:**\
  There is a tweak for one field if the program is running in a specific environment (CICS).
- **Rollup Fields:**\
  The rollup report text field is not copied directly. Instead, it is cleared, and a special routine is called to process and validate the rollup data.
- **Time Fields:**\
  All open/close time fields for each day of the week are checked for blanks or defaults and set accordingly. Special conversions are performed if the program is working with Oracle or certain row operations.
- **Final Normalization:**\
  After all fields are processed, the destination record is considered normalized and ready for further use.

---

## c. Rollup Data Validation

The rollup report field, which is a text field representing an array of numbers, is handled with extra care:

- The text is reinterpreted as an array of ten numbers.
- Each number is checked: if it is numeric, it is copied to the destination; if not, the destination field is set to zero.
- This ensures that only valid numeric data is stored in the rollup fields, preventing data corruption or errors in downstream processing.

---

## d. Time Field Conversion

Time fields (open/close times for each day) are handled differently depending on the database environment:

- **Oracle or Insert/Modify Operations:**\
  All time fields are packed into an array and a conversion mode is set. An external routine is called to convert these times into timestamp format suitable for Oracle. If the conversion fails, an error message is constructed; if successful, the results are unpacked into the appropriate timestamp fields.
- **Other Environments:**\
  If not working with Oracle, the time fields are simply copied as-is from the input to the destination structure.

---

## e. Database Connection Setup

When a connection to Oracle is required:

- The program calls a connection routine, passing the necessary parameters.
- If the connection fails, it captures the SQL error code and constructs a detailed error message for reporting.
- The actual connection logic is handled by a lower-level routine, which manages the database state.

---

## f. Summary

The overall flow ensures that:

- All input data is validated, normalized, and defaulted according to business rules.
- Special fields (rollup and time fields) receive extra validation and conversion as needed.
- Database connections are established only when required, with robust error handling.
- The resulting data structures are ready for safe and consistent database operations, regardless of the underlying database system.

---

This approach ensures data integrity, consistency, and compatibility across different database environments, while providing clear error reporting and handling for any issues encountered during processing.

110-MOVE-PDA-FIELDS-2-DCL copies and validates a ton of fields from the source to the destination structure. It checks for empty or special values in date/time fields and assigns defaults if needed, sets indicator variables based on field values, and applies business rules for flags and switches. Numeric fields are validated and defaulted if not numeric. There's also a CICS-specific tweak for one field. Next, it calls 117-MOVE-ROLLUP-DATA to handle rollup report fields, since those need extra validation and can't just be copied directly.

117-MOVE-ROLLUP-DATA takes the rollup report text from the source, reinterprets it as an array of 10 numbers, and for each one, checks if it's numeric. If it is, it copies it to the destination; if not, it sets the destination field to zero. This avoids bad data in the rollup fields.

112-MOVE-TIME-FIELDS checks if we're working with Oracle or doing an insert/modify. If so, it packs all the open/close times for each day into an array, sets the conversion mode, and calls MMMS0291 to convert them to timestamps. If the conversion works, it unpacks the results into timestamp fields; if not, it sets an error message. If we're not in Oracle mode, it just copies the time fields over as-is. The call to MMMS0291 is what actually does the time-to-timestamp conversion.

### Database Connection Setup

<SwmSnippet path="/base/src/NNNS0488.cbl" line="1674">

115-CONNECT-TO-ORACLE calls Z-ORA-CONNECT to try to open a connection to Oracle using the current parameters. If it doesn't work, it grabs the SQL error code and builds an error message for reporting. The actual connection logic is handled by XXXS0210, which sets up the DB state.

```cobol
